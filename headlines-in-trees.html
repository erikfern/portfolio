        <span id="artwork-title-inline">Headlines in Trees</span> is a work-in-progress group project for York University's Digital Media program's capstone course. This data visualization project attempts to visualize the sum of a userâ€™s political opinions through the online article headlines they share on social media. This project is meant to bring awareness to the idea that relying on an article headline to represent a person's political view may end up misrepresenting them when the discourse found in the content sends a different message.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using the Unity engine, the Steam VR plugin, and by creating our own set of metrics to assess the overall quality of an online article's content, we attempt to visualize the sum of the user's political opinions through a tree that grows differently each time they select (or "share") an article headline which then appears in the virtual reality space. The tree represents the calculated average quality of all the articles' content selected by the user, and the users have no way of assessing an article's quality (i.e. reading it) besides guessing the quality of its content through its headline.
      </p>

      <p>
        My primary contribution is to create a system for building a tree that alters its appearance each time an article headline is shared. This is achieved by building tree from the bottom-up recursively by stacking branches (represented as thin 3D rectangles) on top of each other until it starts generating leaves (represented as spheres) towards the end of the recursion. The tree generated is able to change a few of its properties depending on the input given by the articles. For example, a the tree will generate longer branches if the article selected is lengthy and covers the subject in great detail.
