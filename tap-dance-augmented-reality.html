        <P>
          For a class assignment, our group was tasked to create a narrative around a pair of tap shoes through an augmented reality-based mobile application while also implementing a solution to generate 3D objects without the use of markers.
        </P>

        <p>
            Our application features six 2D planes playing tap dancing videos positioned above a large pair of tap shoes. The narrative is about showing the declining popularity of tap dancing by comparing tap dancing videos from the previous century to this century. Stage production values in videos made in the 1900s are shown to be higher but have less video quality, while stage production in videos made in the 2000s are less but have higher video quality. The second part of the narrative ends with an optimistic note as it invites the current generation to take part in the tap dancing culture using modern technology. By tapping on the screen, the users can imitate tap dancing by laying virtual footprints on the floor.

            This mobile application is made using Unity with the Vuforia engine.
