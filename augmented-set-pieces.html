            <P>
                <i>Augmented Set Pieces</i> is a collection of virtual set pieces used for a series of short performances by the York Dance Ensemble team. Each dance performance relies on both movement and the virtual content projected from augmented reality markers to tell a narrative.
            </P>

            <p>
                The markers are either attached to the walls or the floor to establish an environment or are attached to the performers as part of their costume. The audience is given a mobile device with a preinstalled application to view the virtual content through a camera.
            </p>

            <p>
                The mobile application is made using Unity with the Vuforia engine. Some 3D models were edited and animated with Maya.
