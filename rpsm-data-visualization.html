      <P>
      	This assignment is from York University's course in the Digital Media program, DATT 3935: Creative Data Visualization. This assignment aims to use a set of data and visualize it in an organized, and aesthetically compelling manner. The data presented is an attempt to help a non-profit after school music program plan logistics for marketing and hosting events. Given a dataset of anonymous students enrolled in the program, the organization wants to determine the best positions to launch promotional campaigns.
      </P>

      <p>
      	This data visualization assignment is created using Processing, a Java-based software used for creative coding, with the Unfolding Maps library. The application parses the dataset as a CSV file and places each student on the map based on their associated coordinates. Other information on the students are given visual indicators, such as colour or text, with the most relevant information being immediately noticeable. For example, the students' location, the school they go to, the days when they attend the after school program, and their families' average yearly income are immediately shown and organized for better visibility on the map; information that are less important such as the type of classes they are enrolled and the length of the classes are hidden unless the user hovers their mouse cursor on a student.
      </p>

      <p>
      	In addition to this assignment serving as a demonstration of my knowledge in data visualization, this is also an exercise in problem solving and in UI design. How I organized the data and the decisions made in designing the application's UI communicates one approach to their problem that I believe to be the most optimal: by directing the user's attention more towards the schools where classes take place, the average income of each student attending in those schools, and the days when they attend classes, the organizers can better determine which neighborhoods to prioritize and which days to launch their marketing campaigns.
